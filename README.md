# Facebook-Miner

Facebook provides an API for extracting company and customer comments called Graph API. It is the primary way to get data into and out of the Facebook platform. It's a low-level HTTP-based API that apps can use to programmatically query data, post new stories, manage ads, upload photos, and perform a wide variety of other tasks[6].
